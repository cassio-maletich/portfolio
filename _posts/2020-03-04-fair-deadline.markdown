# The Fair Deadline
As the lead developer for a native app project, I took on the responsibility of creating a high-quality application for a company with a tight deadline. Acting as the senior developer, I was primarily responsible for the front-end development using React Native. My role involved not only writing and optimizing code but also communicating the project's needs to the rest of the development team.
  
The backend system, built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, had to be developed in a very short time frame to meet the specific requirements of an upcoming trade fair. Coordinating closely with the backend team, we worked efficiently to ensure seamless integration between the front-end and back-end components.
  
Despite the pressure and tight schedule, we successfully delivered a fully functional app in time for the trade fair. This project highlighted my ability to lead a team, manage critical timelines, and deliver a robust application under challenging conditions.
