# Actions speak louder than words
Faced with a challenging native app project, our team initially lacked the necessary expertise. The client had already provided a layout and built a backend for the project, but the previous company they hired had failed to deliver. With a tight deadline of 45 days to create a minimum viable product (MVP), the pressure was on.
  
To quickly bridge the knowledge gap, my company invested in a one-week React course for me. This rapid upskilling enabled us to tackle the project head-on. Despite our limited experience in this area, we were determined to make the most of this opportunity.
  
We worked diligently, leveraging our newly acquired React skills and collaborating closely with the client to ensure we met their expectations. Our goal was to integrate the client's existing layout with their backend, creating a functional and appealing MVP.
  
In a little over a month, we successfully delivered the MVP, exceeding the client's expectations. This achievement not only showcased our ability to learn and adapt quickly but also earned the client's trust and confidence in our capabilities.
  
This project demonstrated my commitment to overcoming challenges and delivering high-quality results, even under tight deadlines and with minimal prior experience.
