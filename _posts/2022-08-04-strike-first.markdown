I undertook a complex project involving the migration from the Amazon Marketplace API to the new Selling Partner API, driven by the need to comply with updated privacy laws. This migration presented significant challenges, akin to rebuilding an entire application to accommodate specific regulatory requirements.
  
While preserving existing functionalities such as Devise authentication and the underlying data structure, our team focused on integrating new features and processes mandated by the Selling Partner API. This included creating new workers and implementing recurring tasks using Sidekiq to handle critical operations seamlessly.
  
Throughout the migration process, meticulous attention was paid to ensure data integrity and compliance with privacy regulations. We navigated technical intricacies and regulatory nuances to successfully deploy the updated application, meeting stringent privacy standards without compromising functionality.
  
This project highlighted my ability to lead complex migrations, adapt to evolving regulatory frameworks, and implement robust solutions that align with industry best practices.
