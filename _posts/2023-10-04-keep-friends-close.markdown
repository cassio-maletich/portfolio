# Itâ€™s better to be safe than sorry
I developed a minimum viable product (MVP) for a startup aimed at simplifying the process for investors to assign legally binding contracts. Leveraging the DocuSign API and Ruby on Rails, our team created a robust platform that streamlined contract assignment workflows.
  
The MVP allowed investors to securely and efficiently manage contract assignments, ensuring compliance and legal validity through integration with the DocuSign API. This involved developing custom features and interfaces tailored to the specific needs of investors and legal requirements.
  
By combining my expertise in Ruby on Rails development with the powerful capabilities of the DocuSign API, we delivered a solution that empowered users to handle legal contracts with confidence and ease. This project underscored my ability to conceptualize, develop, and deploy innovative solutions that meet critical business needs.
