# Head first
As the project leader for the new Varilux Brasil website, I took on a multifaceted role that encompassed a range of responsibilities. From the outset, I was involved in gathering requirements directly from the client, ensuring that we had a clear understanding of their needs and goals.
  
One of my primary tasks was developing a significant portion of the front end. This involved writing clean, efficient code and implementing features that enhanced the user experience. In addition to my development duties, I coordinated the efforts of the front-end team, guiding them through the project's various stages and ensuring that our work was cohesive and met the highest standards.
  
A key aspect of the project was the integration with Salesforce. Acting as a mediator, I facilitated the seamless connection between our website and the Salesforce platform. This integration allowed us to provide the most up-to-date optical data possible, which was crucial for the client's operations.
  
One of the standout features of the Varilux Brasil website is the "Onde Comprar" section (https://www.varilux.com.br/onde-comprar/), where users can find affiliated stores using the Google Maps interface. This feature required precise coordination and implementation to ensure that users had accurate and useful information at their fingertips.
  
This project exemplified my ability to lead a team, manage client relationships, and deliver a high-quality product that meets complex requirements. It also highlighted my technical skills and my capacity to bridge the gap between development and client needs.
