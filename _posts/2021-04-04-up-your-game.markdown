# Up your Game
My first experience working on a massive app with thousands of concurrent users daily was challenging and rewarding. One of my initial assignments was to create a new subscription tier with limited functionality. This task provided a deep dive into the complexities of maintaining and enhancing a large-scale application.
  
Working with such a vast codebase was a great learning experience. It wasn't always necessary to change everything, but when specific points were touched, it became clear that gradual updates were essential. This involved phasing out old gems and practices and implementing more modern, efficient solutions.
  
Rather than being constrained by a rigid, hardcoded plan, we chose to create a new database model that would be used to dynamically manage plans. This decision allowed for greater flexibility and adaptability in managing the subscription plans in the future as it can be changed by a non technical person.
  
This project taught me the importance of incremental improvement and careful managing dependencies in a large application. It was a valuable opportunity to refine my skills in navigating and optimizing extensive codebases, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Allowing admins to seamlessly manage plans from the panel they were already familiar with was a plus I delivered based on the expectations I have as a user.
